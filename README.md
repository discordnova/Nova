Nova is an open source Discord framework for creating high-performance app.

Nova is built upon [Go](https://github.com/golang/go) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) and uses [Bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel) as a build system to maintain an effective, safe and production-ready solution.

With Nova you can be sure to build reliable and efficient Discord bots.

### Disclaimer

Nova requires a good infrastructure to operate and may consume lot of resources. It's not made for small Discord Bots but for those who are present on many servers and want to ensure excellent performance.
